## Introduction
Instantly is an open-source, freeware, easy-to-use, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file transfer application for Android devices. It allows users to share any type of file (apps, multimedia, documents, etc.) at lightning speed without any limitations on file size or format, using the latest Wi-Fi Direct technology. Instantly comes with amazing features and capabilities, listed below.



## Features

- File is transferred using multiple network connectivity including Wi-Fi and Hotspot.
- QR code scanner allows for quick connection establishment.
- Available both as a web app and an Android app.
- Supports all file types without any limitation on size.
- Internet Share functionality allows users to share files between two devices over the internet in a simple and secure manner.
- Built on a peer-to-peer and server-less architecture that eliminates the need for an intermediate third-party to control and access the data, providing data privacy and security.
- Open source project, meaning anyone can access, modify and update the code as per their need.


## Why Create Instantly?
Sharing data across different devices such as Android, iOS, Mac, and PC used to be a very tedious and time-consuming process. The traditional methods of file sharing such as Bluetooth, Online Storage or cable transfer are not only slow but many times different devices do not support these methods of file transfer across different platforms. 

Today's software solutions are full of bloatware and adware, and some come with complicated design and unnecessary features that clutter the UI, making it less user-friendly and consuming a lot of CPU processing power, and also draining battery fast.

## Limitations
Currently, the project only supports **one file transfer at a time**. In case the user wants to transfer multiple files at once, they need to convert those files to zip and then send it. Similarly, on the receiving end, they need to decompress the zip. The speed of transfer is limited by available network bandwidth and device hardware capabilities, and there is no specific limitation of speed by the site.
## Instantly-Web
Instantly-web is a powerful browser-based solution for sharing files across the internet, eliminating the need for downloading and installing an app. With this amazing feature, users can effortlessly share files with any device, regardless of their location, making it an essential tool for those seeking an easy and efficient file sharing solution.
